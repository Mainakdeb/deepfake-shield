## What is a Deepfake?
The term “DeepFake” is referred to a deep learning based technique that is able able to swap the face of a person by the face of another person in images.

## The Problem 
The free access to large-scale public databases, together with the fast progress of deep learning techniques has made it easy for anyone to create deepfakes. Some of the harmful usages of such fake content include fake news, hoaxes, blackmailing and financial fraud.

## Our Solution
Deepfake Shield uses deep-learning techniques to classify deepfakes in images. The diagram below summarises our project. Feel free to try out the web-app - https://deepfake-shield.herokuapp.com/
